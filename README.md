## Completed

ML Classifier - a classifier that can automatically identify and categorize the instruction set architecture of a random binary blob. Train a machine learning classifier to identify the architecture of a binary blob given a list of possible architectures. The model is trained around samples of twelve architectures, including: avr, alphaev56, arm, m68k, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390, sh4, sparc, x86_64, and xtensa.

## In Progress

Crypto - A mixture of classic cryptology, stegonography, and other crypyography techniques. Iteratively built to auto solve prior levels.
